# Car-Racing-Game

Implements python's pygame to develop a car racing game. The user is greeted with an introductory screen and begins the race shortly thereafter. The car starts at the beginning of the track and the user must make it past obstacles and a curved track to get to reach the finish line as fast as possible. The user is timed and the time is recorded and presented at the end of the game. Elements such as collision detection and 2-D directional movements are present in this project.
