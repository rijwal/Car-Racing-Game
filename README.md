# Car-Racing-Game

Implements pygame to develop a car racing game. User is greeted with introductory screen and begins race shortly thereafter. The car starts at the beginning of the track and the user must make it past obstacles and a swervy track to get to reach the finish line as fast as possible. The user is timed and the time is recorded and presented at the end of the game. Elements such as collison detection and 2-D directional movements are present in this project.
